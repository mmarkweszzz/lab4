for question A,the name of double average(double * n1, double & n2) in my compiler is 000000000040077d t _GLOBAL__sub_I__Z7averagePdRd and the name of int average(int n1, float n2) is 00000000004006cd T _Z7averagePdRd.
for question B,the bits of char a,int b ,float c,double d,is 1,4,4,8,and the bits of char *pa,int *pb ,float *pc,double *pd,are all 8,as we know ,char is 1,and int is equal to float,and double is twice than float,and all of pointers are 8.
